# SOS-game-AI-Training

The SOS Game AI Training project aims to develop an AI model capable of playing the SOS game. The game is played on a 6x6 grid, where players aim to score more points than their opponent by creating SOS sequences. The project includes the implementation of a Q-learning algorithm to train the AI model and improve its gameplay strategy.
